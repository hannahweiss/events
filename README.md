# EventApp

Includes code from and based on Prof Tuck's in-class [PhotoBlog](https://github.com/NatTuck/photo_blog/) example.

User invites to events are based on username, this app does not allow registration of two users with the same name.


Profile photos that are uploaded should be a square image.
